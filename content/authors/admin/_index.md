Hello! I'm a masters student at the [Univeristy of Alberta Department of Computing Science](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html) and [Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute](https://www.amii.ca/) supervised by [James Wright](https://jrwright.info/). Previously, I completed my BSc in Honors Computing Science at the University of Alberta. 

Broadly, my research interests are algorithmic game theory and reinforcement learning. In particular, I'm interested in algorithms that learn how to interact in strategic settings through self-play and the equilibria that systems of learning agents can converge to.
